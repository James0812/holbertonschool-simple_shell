# Simple Shell

## Description
Simple Shell (hsh) is a minimal UNIX command interpreter written in C.
It behaves like the standard shell /bin/sh and supports both **interactive** and **non-interactive** modes.

The shell:
- Reads commands from the user or from a file/pipe.
- Searches for the executable in the PATH.
- Creates a child process for execution using fork.
- Executes the command with execve.
- Waits for the process to finish with wait.
- Handles errors and built-in commands like exit.
- Ignores empty lines or lines containing only spaces or tabs.
- Resolves commands using the PATH environment variable if the command is not an absolute path.
- Supports built-in commands exit and env.
- Returns appropriate exit status (0 on success, 127 if command not found, or child process status).

## Compilation
To compile the shell on **Ubuntu 20.04**:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 🔹 Simple Shell 0.0
- Displays a prompt ($)` 
Reads a command line from standard input
Executes simple commands without arguments

🔹 Simple Shell 0.1 - Handle command lines with arguments
Supports commands with arguments
Example:
ls -l /tmp
### 🔹 Simple Shell 0.2 - Handle the PATH
- Searches for commands in directories listed in the PATH variable
- fork() is not called if the command does not exist
- Correct handling of an empty PATH
UNIX-compliant error message:
```bash
/hsh: 1: ls: not found
```
Exit status:
- 127 → command not found

### 🔹 Simple Shell 0.3 - Built-in exit
- Implements the built-in command
exit
- Exits the shell using the last command's exit status
- No argument handling required

### 🔹 Simple Shell 0.4 - Built-in env
- Prints the current environment variables:
env




## Usage
Interactive mode:
- Run ./hsh to start the shell.
- The prompt ($) is displayed when waiting for user input.

## Non-interactive mode:
- Run commands from a file or pipe: echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh.

## Built-in commands:
- exit to terminate the shell.
- env to print the current environment variables.

## Technical Details
- The shell reads user input using getline.
- Commands are tokenized using spaces and tabs.
- Forks a child process to execute external commands using execve.
- Waits for child process completion using wait or waitpid.
- Resolves commands via PATH if not provided as absolute path.
